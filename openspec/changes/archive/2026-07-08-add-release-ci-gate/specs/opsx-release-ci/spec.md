## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Release CI workflow

OPSX MUST provide a tracked CI workflow that runs the release verification
baseline on pushes, pull requests and manual dispatch.

#### Scenario: CI runs for repository changes
- **WHEN** the OPSX CI workflow is triggered by `push`, `pull_request` or
  `workflow_dispatch`
- **THEN** it runs OpenSpec validation, docs/config parsing checks and Python
  syntax checks
- **AND** it exits non-zero when any required command fails

### Requirement: Template and bootstrap smoke in CI

OPSX CI MUST exercise project templates and bootstrap/verify behavior through
red/green smoke commands.

#### Scenario: Template or bootstrap drift breaks generated projects
- **WHEN** template, bootstrap or verification wiring is broken
- **THEN** the CI workflow runs `scripts/smoke-verify-project.py` and
  `scripts/smoke-bootstrap-project.py`
- **AND** the workflow fails before release-facing changes can be accepted

### Requirement: Drift and wiring smoke in CI

OPSX CI MUST run drift and wiring discovery checks without requiring private
workspace inventory.

#### Scenario: CI checks drift and wiring safely
- **WHEN** CI reaches smoke verification
- **THEN** it runs `scripts/smoke-wiring-discovery.py`
- **AND** it runs `scripts/smoke-drift.py` against a generated generic runtime
  project
- **AND** committed workflow content contains no private workspace inventory

### Requirement: CI workflow contract smoke

OPSX MUST provide a local smoke check that validates the tracked CI workflow
contains the required release gates.

#### Scenario: Maintainer edits the workflow
- **WHEN** `python3 scripts/smoke-release-ci.py` runs
- **THEN** it fails if the CI workflow is missing required triggers or command
  strings
- **AND** it passes only when all required release gates are present
