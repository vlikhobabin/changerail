## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Release CI inventory coverage
ChangeRail release CI MUST discover and compile tracked Python helper and smoke
files under `bin/` and `scripts/` from repository inventory instead of relying
on a manually maintained incomplete file list.

#### Scenario: New Python helper is tracked
- **WHEN** a Python helper or smoke script is tracked under `bin/` or `scripts/`
- **THEN** release CI includes that file in the syntax compile gate
- **AND** a syntax error in that file fails the release workflow

### Requirement: Release CI focused smoke inventory
ChangeRail release CI MUST run the focused smoke scripts that protect delivery
runner, delivery metrics, review fingerprint, review verdict validation,
manifest derivation, bootstrap, verify, wiring discovery, archive diagnostics,
release workflow contract and drift fixture behavior.

#### Scenario: Focused smoke coverage regresses
- **WHEN** the tracked CI workflow no longer invokes a required focused smoke
  command
- **THEN** `scripts/smoke-release-ci.py` fails before the workflow change can
  be accepted

### Requirement: Release CI lint gate
ChangeRail release CI MUST run a pinned lint gate for tracked Python helpers and
scripts.

#### Scenario: Unused import reaches release gate
- **WHEN** `ruff check bin scripts` reports an unused import or equivalent
  lint failure
- **THEN** release CI exits non-zero before publish
