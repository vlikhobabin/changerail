## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Release CI validates ChangeRail fixtures
Release CI MUST run bootstrap, verify, wiring and drift smoke against generated
ChangeRail fixtures after the rename.

#### Scenario: Release CI runs
- **WHEN** the release CI workflow executes after the rename
- **THEN** generated fixture paths and reports use the ChangeRail runtime
  namespace
- **AND** release smoke fails if generated defaults still use OPSX wiring
