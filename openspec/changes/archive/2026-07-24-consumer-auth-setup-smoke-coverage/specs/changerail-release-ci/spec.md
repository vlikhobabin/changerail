## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Consumer Codex auth setup smoke coverage
ChangeRail release baseline MUST include focused smoke coverage for the
consumer Codex auth setup contract across bootstrap, verification and delivery
runner preflight surfaces.

#### Scenario: Release baseline checks auth setup contract
- **WHEN** the local release baseline or release CI focused smoke set runs
- **THEN** it covers bootstrap opt-in auth link behavior, verification readiness
  advisory behavior and delivery runner auth remediation diagnostics
- **AND** it does not require real Codex credentials

#### Scenario: Smoke keeps credentials out of output
- **WHEN** smoke tests create temporary fake auth marker contents
- **THEN** tracked test output and structured status assertions do not include
  credential contents or token-like values
