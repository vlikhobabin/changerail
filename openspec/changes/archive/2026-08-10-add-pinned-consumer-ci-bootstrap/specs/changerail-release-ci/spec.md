## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Generated consumer CI regression gate
The ChangeRail release baseline and tracked CI MUST validate the generated
consumer workflow contract and execute a local clean-clone fixture against an
exact strict consumer lock.

#### Scenario: Release baseline runs consumer CI smoke
- **WHEN** `python3 scripts/run-release-baseline.py` executes
- **THEN** it includes structured validation of the generated workflow
- **AND** it includes the local strict-lock clean-clone consumer fixture

#### Scenario: Workflow uses a floating ChangeRail reference
- **WHEN** the template no longer reads an exact lock revision
- **THEN** release CI smoke fails

#### Scenario: Workflow gains write authority
- **WHEN** the template adds repository write, commit, push or publish behavior
- **THEN** release CI smoke fails before release publication

### Requirement: Consumer CI failure fixtures
Release smoke MUST cover absent/malformed/advisory locks, unavailable revision,
owned wiring conflict and successful exact-revision verification.

#### Scenario: CI negative matrix runs
- **WHEN** focused consumer CI smoke executes
- **THEN** every unsafe or non-reproducible fixture exits non-zero
- **AND** the successful fixture proves the same local and CI verification path
