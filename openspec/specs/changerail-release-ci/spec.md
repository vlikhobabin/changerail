# changerail-release-ci Specification

## Purpose

Зафиксировать release-facing CI gate для ChangeRail: OpenSpec validation,
docs/config checks, Python smoke checks, templates/bootstrap/verify/drift and
wiring discovery.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Release CI workflow
ChangeRail MUST provide a tracked CI workflow that runs the release verification
baseline on pushes, pull requests and manual dispatch.
Release CI MUST run the strengthened public-surface scan for current public
roots and reachable history.

#### Scenario: CI runs for repository changes
- **WHEN** the ChangeRail CI workflow is triggered by `push`, `pull_request` or
  `workflow_dispatch`
- **THEN** it runs OpenSpec validation, docs/config parsing checks and Python
  syntax checks
- **AND** it exits non-zero when any required command fails

#### Scenario: CI runs strengthened public-safety scan
- **WHEN** the ChangeRail CI workflow runs
- **THEN** it runs the public-surface scanner self-test
- **AND** it runs the scanner against current public roots and reachable
  history

### Requirement: Template and bootstrap smoke in CI

ChangeRail CI MUST exercise project templates and bootstrap/verify behavior through
red/green smoke commands.

#### Scenario: Template or bootstrap drift breaks generated projects
- **WHEN** template, bootstrap or verification wiring is broken
- **THEN** the CI workflow runs `scripts/smoke-verify-project.py` and
  `scripts/smoke-bootstrap-project.py`
- **AND** the workflow fails before release-facing changes can be accepted

### Requirement: Drift and wiring smoke in CI

ChangeRail CI MUST run drift and wiring discovery checks without requiring private
workspace inventory.

#### Scenario: CI checks drift and wiring safely
- **WHEN** CI reaches smoke verification
- **THEN** it runs `scripts/smoke-wiring-discovery.py`
- **AND** it runs `scripts/smoke-drift.py` against a generated generic runtime
  project
- **AND** committed workflow content contains no private workspace inventory

### Requirement: CI workflow contract smoke
ChangeRail MUST provide a local smoke check that validates the tracked CI workflow
contains the required release gates.
CI workflow contract smoke MUST require the strengthened scanner commands.

#### Scenario: Maintainer edits the workflow
- **WHEN** `python3 scripts/smoke-release-ci.py` runs
- **THEN** it fails if the CI workflow is missing required triggers or command
  strings
- **AND** it passes only when all required release gates are present

#### Scenario: CI smoke requires history scan command
- **WHEN** `python3 scripts/smoke-release-ci.py` runs
- **THEN** it fails if the CI workflow no longer invokes the scanner history
  mode

### Requirement: Release CI validates ChangeRail fixtures
Release CI MUST run bootstrap, verify, wiring and drift smoke against generated
ChangeRail fixtures after the rename.

#### Scenario: Release CI runs
- **WHEN** the release CI workflow executes after the rename
- **THEN** generated fixture paths and reports use the ChangeRail runtime
  namespace
- **AND** release smoke fails if generated defaults still use OPSX wiring

### Requirement: CI covers generated workflow guidance
Release CI MUST run bootstrap smoke coverage that fails when generated workflow
guidance drifts from the current ChangeRail process.

#### Scenario: Template workflow guidance regresses
- **WHEN** release CI runs `scripts/smoke-bootstrap-project.py`
- **THEN** missing lifecycle, role model, fresh review or board finalization
  guidance in generated files fails the CI smoke
