# changerail-release-discipline Specification

## Purpose

Зафиксировать release discipline для ChangeRail как самостоятельной публичной
технологии: semver, changelog, compatibility notes и migration notes.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Semantic version source

ChangeRail MUST publish the current project version in a root `VERSION` file using
semantic version format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

#### Scenario: Maintainer checks current version
- **WHEN** a maintainer reads `VERSION`
- **THEN** the file contains exactly one semantic version string
- **AND** release docs explain how pre-1.0 and stable releases use semver

### Requirement: Changelog with breaking markers

ChangeRail MUST maintain a root `CHANGELOG.md` that records public changes by
version and marks breaking changes explicitly.

#### Scenario: Consumer checks whether an update is breaking
- **WHEN** a consumer reads changelog entries for a target ChangeRail version
- **THEN** any breaking workflow, schema, template, skill, command or helper
  change is marked with a `BREAKING:` prefix
- **AND** non-breaking additions and fixes are grouped separately from breaking
  entries

### Requirement: Tool compatibility notes

ChangeRail MUST document compatibility expectations for Codex CLI, Claude Code and
OpenSpec CLI.

#### Scenario: Operator prepares to update local tools
- **WHEN** an operator reviews ChangeRail compatibility notes
- **THEN** the notes identify Codex CLI, Claude Code and OpenSpec CLI support
  status
- **AND** the OpenSpec CLI compatibility note references the pin used by
  `bin/openspec`

### Requirement: Migration notes between versions

ChangeRail MUST maintain migration notes for version-to-version updates that affect
consumer projects or operator workflow.

#### Scenario: Consumer updates ChangeRail
- **WHEN** a consumer moves from one ChangeRail version to another
- **THEN** migration notes describe required update steps, verification gates
  and rollback considerations
- **AND** migration examples use public generic paths only

### Requirement: Product rename migration notes
ChangeRail release discipline MUST treat the OPSX to ChangeRail rename as a
breaking migration for consumers.

#### Scenario: Consumer reads rename release notes
- **WHEN** a consumer reads the release notes for the rename version
- **THEN** the notes mark source path, command namespace, skill namespace,
  helper and schema namespace changes as breaking where applicable
- **AND** the notes describe `/opt/changerail` as the canonical source-of-truth
  path

#### Scenario: Operator renames the GitHub repository
- **WHEN** the GitHub repository is renamed from `opsx` to `changerail`
- **THEN** migration docs describe updating local `origin` to the new
  repository URL
- **AND** old repository URLs are treated as compatibility redirects, not
  canonical documentation targets
